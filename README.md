### Delete a Reservation

- **Method**: DELETE
- **URL**: `https://bmbx799vwi.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/reservations/{id}`

## Error Handling

Errors are returned as JSON responses with HTTP status codes:

- **400**: Bad request (e.g., missing data).
- **404**: Resource not found (e.g., reservation not found).
- **500**: Internal server error (e.g., unexpected issues).

### Example Error Response
- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
  "statusCode": 404,
  "message": "Reservation ID {id} not found"
  }

## Environment Variables

The API uses the following environment variables (configurable in `serverless.yml`):

- **AWS_REGION**: AWS region for deployment (default: `eu-north-1`).
- **DYNAMODB_TABLE**: DynamoDB table name (default: `bonz-ai-db`).

## Deployment

To deploy the API, use the following command in your terminal:

serverless deploy

After deployment, you will receive the endpoints for accessing your API functions.

## Testing the API

You can test the API using tools like Postman or cURL.

## Additional Notes

Ensure that all IAM roles and permissions are correctly configured in AWS to allow the Lambda functions to interact with DynamoDB as defined in the `serverless.yml` configuration.
